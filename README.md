# Demo

To start your Phoenix server:

  * If you use window install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and install Ubuntu ask chatGPT if you don't know then clone this repo in WSL. Use WSL to run.
  * Run `mix deps.get` to install and setup dependencies then run `mix compile` any error go ask chatGPT.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Open OBS then go setting -> Stream -> Service -> Custom -> Server -> rtmp://localhost:9006 -> Stream key -> hehe.
If you want to change stream key go lib/dem/application.ex. If you want to change server I don't know.
